# Description

This documentation is about the *Python* codes :

- cloneFromGit.py
- Conversion.py
- write.py
- do_it.py

The initial idea was to render a Hugo website with the *Python* codes -> automate some tedious tasks:

1. Clone a repository from GitHub
2. Convert a file from one format to markdown (if possible), write their headers and place them in the content folder of the Hugo website
3. Copy all the files that can't be converted to markdown to the static folder of the Hugo website
4. Write a configuration file for the Hugo website (or copy it from the theme exempleSite folder)

## Clone a repository from GitHub
