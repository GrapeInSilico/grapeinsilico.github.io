HydroShoot solves jointly the following processes:
1. The hydraulic map of the shoot, that is the value of xylem water potential across all stem elements and petioles, following an Ohmic approach (Tyree and Evers, 1991 New Phytologist 119, 345-360).
2. Leaf gas-exchange fluxes using the analytical solution of Yin and Struik (2009 Wageningen Journal of Life Sciences 57, 27-38) which couples the photosynthetic model of Farquhar et al. (1980 Planta 149, 78-90) to the stomatal conductance model of Leuning (1995 Plant, Cell and Environment 18, 339-355).
3. Leaf energy budget considering radiative and convective transfers (Nobel P. 2005 Physicochemical and Environmental Plant Physiology. Elsevier Academic Press).
