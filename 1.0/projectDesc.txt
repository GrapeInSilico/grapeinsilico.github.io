The objective of GrapeInSilico is to create a modelling and simulation environment for the vine and the vineyard, which will be modular and integrative, allowing to promote and distribute the latest developments for a variety of applications. The project includes in a large cycle of researchers (4 laboratories are involved: LEPSE, AGAP, EFGV & SAVE).  The main stake is the advancement of a collective modelling strategy that facilitates the transmission, the sharing and the valorisation of knowledge that is currently dispersed in different models that are not directly interoperable. 
Main applications will be dedicated to the simulation of carbon balance and water fluxes within the plant and towards the fruits from different types of input data (manual measurements, digitizing, T-LiDAR). Meanwhile, the platform will include other models allowing the estimation of the impact of fungal disease on growing structures depending on the developmental stages of the plant. The final objective of this project will be to transfer these models to professionals to help them towards the definition of new ideotypes and training practices more adapted to climate change.
