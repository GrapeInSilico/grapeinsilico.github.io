### Description
The water balance model (Lebon et al., 2003) is based on the geometrical canopy model proposed by Riou et al. (1989) for vertical shoot positioned trellises, coupled to a soilâ€“water balance routine accounting separately for grapevine transpiration and bare soil evaporation. It requires reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and rainfall as water inputs, daily solar radiation for solar radiation interception modeling, and daily air temperature for canopy development modeling (crop coefficient) based on degree days.
